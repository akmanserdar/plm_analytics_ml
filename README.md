# plm_appovals
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of change request (CR) approvals within a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system. The analysis includes Multiple Linear Regression as a machine learning (ML) model to optimize the approval process.

# Example Use Case
Let's say we have a sample change request input with the following features:

**Change_Type:** Major  
**Complexity:** 8  
**Department:** Engineering  
**Requested_By:** UserA  

Using the predictive model we developed, you can forecast the approval time for this request. The model predicts that this change request will take 17.07 days to approve.

# Actionable Steps:

**Assign Optimized KPI:** Set realistic deadlines and expectations with change request (CR) owners.

**Improved Planning and Scheduling:** Plan project phases with more precision, knowing when approvals are likely to be completed.

**Prioritize Review:** Knowing that this request will take longer, prioritize its review to avoid project delays.

**Allocate Resources:** Ensure that the necessary resources (e.g., reviewers, subject matter experts) are available to expedite the process.

**Communicate:** Inform the relevant stakeholders about the expected approval time and any potential impacts on the project timeline.

**Monitor Progress:** Track the progress of the approval process closely and prevent if any delays occur.
