## Description

*This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of change request (CR) approvals within a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system. The analysis includes Multiple Linear Regression as a machine learning (ML) model to optimize the approval process.*

## Example Use Case
Let's say we have a sample CR input with the following features:

**Change_Type:** Major  
**Complexity:** 8  
**Department:** Engineering  
**Requested_By:** UserA  

Using the model of Multiple Linear Regression we developed, you can predict the ***approval time*** for this request. The model predicts that *"This CR will take 17.07 days to approve."*

## Actionable Steps

**Assign Optimized KPI:** Set realistic deadlines and expectations with CR owners.  

**Improved Planning and Scheduling:** Plan project phases with more accuracy, knowing when approvals are likely to be completed.  

**Prioritize Review:** Knowing that this request will take longer, prioritize its review to avoid project delays.  

**Allocate Resources:** Ensure that the necessary resources (e.g., reviewers, subject matter experts) are available to expedite the process.  

**Communicate:** Inform the relevant stakeholders about the expected approval time and any potential impacts on the project timeline.  

**Monitor Progress:** Track the progress of the approval process closely and prevent if any delays occur.
